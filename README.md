<h1>Coffee Project Co.</h1>
<h2>User-Centric Frontend Development – Code Institute – Milestone 1</h2>

My passion for coffee led me to create this fictional company’s website, a wholesale coffee roaster, which had recently incorporated training to their services.

The website highlights three aspects of the company’s services: the variety of coffee beans they offer, their new SCA training courses and brewing guides.

I created a basic logo on https://www.canva.com using a free icon found at https://www.iconfinder.com

UX

My number one goal was to make it easy to access information on the site while striving for a trendy urban industrial design. My design choice was based purely on personal preferences. I owned and managed a coffee shop for 10 years and this project somehow is a reflection of what I would have loved my business to be.

Urban Industrial combines utilitarian design with worn textures and the warmth of raw, aged woods.
There are a few common elements that tend to be found in urban industrial spaces. They include, but are not limited to:
Exposed brick walls
Cement floors
Raw, unfinished materials
Sleek, metal and glass lighting
Exposed beams
Stainless steel accents

Colour palette, I used the <em>image to colour generator</em> from https://www.schemecolor.com (based on a small analysis of some sample industrial design images found online).

For prospective customers and baristas alike, I wanted to provide them with a brief overview of what the Coffee Project Co. does and how, as well as with the option to get in contact should they require more information/schedule a meeting with a sales representative.

Links to the SCA website, my GitHub and downloadable PDF versions of some brewing techniques were also provided for their ease of access.
