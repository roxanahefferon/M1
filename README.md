<h1>Coffee Project Co.</h1>
<h2>User-Centric Frontend Development – Code Institute – Milestone 1</h2>

My passion for coffee led me to create this fictional company’s website, a wholesale coffee roaster, which had recently incorporated training to their services.

The website highlights three aspects of the company’s services: the variety of coffee beans they offer, their new SCA training courses and brewing guides.

I created a basic logo on https://www.canva.com using a free icon found at https://www.iconfinder.com

UX

My number one goal was to make it easy to access information on the site while promoting the brand.

My design choice comes from https://visme.co/blog/website-color-schemes/.
This beautiful combination of candy pink, green-yellow, lavender gray and pastel brown is ideal for designs looking to project a vibrant and inviting image.

For prospective customers and baristas alike, I wanted to provide them with a brief overview of what the Coffee Project Co. does and how, as well as with the option to get in contact should they require more information/schedule a meeting with a sales representative.

Links to the SCA website, my GitHub and downloadable PDF versions of some brewing techniques were also provided for their ease of access.
